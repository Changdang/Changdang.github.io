> <em> “A Sanskrit word appeared in the paragraph: ANTEVASIN. It means, ‘one who lives at the border.’ In ancient times, this was a literal description. It indicated a person who had left the bustling center of worldly life to go live at the edge of the forest where the spiritual masters dwelled. The antevasin was not of the villager’s anymore-not a householder with a conventional life. But neither was he yet a transcendent-not one of those sages who live deep in the unexplored woods, fully realized. The antevasin was an in-betweener. He was a border-dweller. He lived in sight of both worlds, but he looked toward the unknown. And he was a scholar.” </em> — Elizabeth Gilbert, Eat, Pray, Love


My childhood dreams of travelling around are recalled vividly ever since I got to know this old Sanskrit word. As a kid from a normal background in Vietnam, it is not easy to travel here and there. But it does not mean my excitements for enchanted and beautiful lands on over the world should be stopped. Instead of getting on airplanes for expedition, I visited here and there through books, magazines and the Internet. I remembered that I could lay on the floor with one hand against the chin while the eyes gazed at the pyramids in Egypt, Jerusalem in Israel or Taj Mahal in India. Getting a bit older, my excitements for those lands have slightly gone because there are so many other things needed to be concerned, though I still like travelling. The concept of Antevasin timely reminded me of those childhood dreams and seemingly set myself back to the track as it should be.

The world is filled with unknown things. Why do I have to limit myself in my own comfort zones and chase after unnecessary values. Why do not I explore as far as I can, learn as many interesting cultures as possible and make as many friends I want to along the journey? Why do not I chase after what truly make me happy as I only have a life to live?

In this "antevasin" category, I would like to invite you, my friends, explore the land I travelled, travel and will travel to with me. Let's have fun together! Hehe
