Baking is not all about manual techniques like cracking the egg shells, folding or stretching the dough, etc. that most people think about as non-brain teaser. In fact, one must also study neuron-consuming knowledge such as physics biology as well as maths such as baker's percentage to make a nice loaf of bread. In this article, I will walk you through basic wrap up about baker's percentage and how it is apply to ensure the accuracy in baking process

<b> What is baker's percentage and its application? </b>

Baker's percentage is a mathematical method widely used in baking so as to calculate the percentage amounts of ingredient needed in the formula based on the percentage of flour weight.

Since each ingredient is weighed, it enables bakers to work with precision using only one unit of measure. In addition, it is quite easy to scale a formula up or down when working with large amount of ingredients. Finally baker's percentage helps create common language among bakers.

<b> How to calculate the percentage of the formula? </b>

Let's say we have this recipe:

|--------|-------|
|  Flour | 120g  |  
|  Water | 80g   |   
|  Salt  | 5g    |   
|  Yeast | 0.5g  |   

As mentioned above, when using baker's percentage, the flour is represented as 100%, and all the other ingredients are expressed as a percentage of the flour's weight.

To determine the percentage of the other ingredients, we divide the weight of each one by the weight of the flour, and then multiply the result by 100 to convert it to a percent.

For example, to calculate the percentage of water, we divide its weight by the flour's and multiply by 100:

(80 รท 120) x 100 = 67%

When we follow the same method, we have the following values for the salt and yeast:

|--------|-------|-------|---|---|
| Flour  |  120g |   100%|   |   |
| Water  |  80g  |   67% |   |   |
| Salt   |  5g   |   4.2%|   |   |
| Yeast  | 0.5g  |  0.4% |   |   |

It is worth noting that by simply looking at the percentages we can assert important thing about this bread which is the hydration. This bread has a 66% hydration. Hydration is defined as the percentage of liquid in a dough based on the flour weight. Hydration affects the process of gluten building and the nature of the final result. Generally speaking, the more water in the dough, the more open the final bread's crumb.

<b> How to convert gram and other metrics from percentage? </b>

Let's say you have the bread formula presented in percentage and you want to make the bread using 150g of flour. How do we calculate the weight of the remaining ingredients?

|--------|-------|-------|---|
| Flour  |  100% |       |   |
| Water  |  75%  |       |   |
| Salt   |  5%   |       |   |
| Yeast  |  2%   |       |   |

To obtain the weights of the remaining ingredients, first we divide the percentage by 100 to obtain a decimal, then multiply the resulting decimal by the weight of the flour. The entire formula would look like this:

|--------|-------|-----|----|---|----|----|
| Flour  |  100% |     |    |   |    | 150|
| Water  |  75   |  /  |100 | * |150 | 113|
| Salt   |  5    |  /  |100 | * |150 | 3.3|
| Yeast  |  2    |  /  |100 | * |150 | 1.3|


Generally speaking, the baker's percentage plays a crucial role in the baking process. It helps ensure the precise formula, ease obstacles when working on large-scale bread baking and create common language among bakers worldwide. Obtaining correct way to calculate and convert the ingredient's percentage shortens the course of making a nice loaf of bread.
