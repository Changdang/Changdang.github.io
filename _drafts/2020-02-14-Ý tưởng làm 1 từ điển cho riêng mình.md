Sound so stupid but not too bad!

I have an idea on creating a dictionary app that allows me to search new words and add them to my own dictionary. Like for example I got this word "woebegone". it is a new word to me and i think it is a cool word. so i decided to add its meaning and usage to my own dictionary for later use.

First, I will insert the word to a box named "search". if the word is already included in my dictionary. It shows the meaning of the words on the screen. If the word has not been included in my dictionary. I will add its meaning and usage to my dictionary.

The objective of the app is to help the users build their own dictionary and measure how many words they have learned. the user can add their own notes relating the word,
