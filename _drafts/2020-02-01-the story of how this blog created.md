Do read if you think love can motivate someone learn how to code!

In late 2015, I met the guy I love. He was a gap year student travelling to South East Asia from Germany. I was a third-year student coming to Saigon for under-graduate education from Travinh, a small but peaceful town in Mekong Delta, Vietnam. Dream of a better future, I went to the September 23rd Park to learn English. It was fun there. I met people like me who wanted to get better English, and I met him, in thousands of tourists I had talked to.   

At first, it was shy and full of passion for love. Those sleepless nights we roamed around Bui Vien area. We did not want to go home. We wanted to spend time together just to talk about all kinds of things. After 2 months of knowing each other, we became couple on his 22th birth day. He said it was his best birthday gift ever. At that time, love is in the air. I ate in love and lived for love.

Just like other couples, the conflicts started when I was back to the ground from day dreams. We both made mistakes, but mostly me, a young girl with too many expectations from her partner. However, we managed to get through because we were blind in love.

In summer 2016, he came back to his mother land after one year of dating. It was a frustrated time for me. The guy I love went home. However, we still got in touch, all thanks to Facebook and Whatsapp. We even thought about marriage. If I could go back in time, I would not hesitate to say yes. However, the story was different in reality and that is how I changed his mindset about marriage and life.

Years passing by, the two people were still in 10, 000 km long distance love. One and a half months in India were the only time we saw each other since he was back home. In these next three years, up and down things came and went away while the frustration was getting bigger and bigger. And that day finally came. The day I realized that I did not how to love him properly or be a good listener is the day I lost contact with him (perhaps forever).

The story above is the story of how this blog was born. The guy I love is passionate about computer. This blog was simply created because I wanted to have a reason to talk and seek for compromises with him during the last fight. Many times, he asked me to work together on a project so as to avoid boredom and renew the relationship. Many times, I said lets see but did not think about it. When he left, I did. But I guess everything is just too late.

Hey my friends who read until this line, can you do me a favor? If you accidentally pass by a hand some and intellectual looking guy on the streets of Berlin or Taiwan. Please help me ask if his name is Adrian Scheffler. If he says yes, congratulations! You find out the guy I love. The guy I love is very friendly and good at listening and attracting others by his vast knowledge and calm. Please do not hesitate to talk to him. And if possible, please tell him that his ex Vietnamese girlfriend would like to greet him, say sorry for all the messes she created, thank him for the motivations he gave and wish him all the best for his dreams. And please help me tell him that Trang finally got the lesson Adrian tried to teach for years. Thank you!
