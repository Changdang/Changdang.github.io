The third day

How are you today? What will you do today? Are you going to the coding meet up? Are you having fun with your projects? How about your life? Do you enjoy it?

I had a great day today because I can fork and use the CV template from some dude's repository on Github. The template was so simple but amazing and professional. I like it alot. https://changdang.github.io/draco/

This morning, I woke up and realized that I  need to move forward with the website more. So lets create the CV. At first, I managed to create my own CV and place it in the homepage. But I do not how to design it. So I surfed on the Internet and realized that people give CV template for free. Hehe. After forking back and forth, I chose the template that I am using right now. Due to school issue, it took me until 10pm to complete the CV. I can not express how happy I was after the CV making was done. The feeling of desiring for something and you got it. You are the one I thought of first after I completed my CV. I want to share with you my efforts as well as how I happy I am. But I realized that our life will never cross again because I got blocked... Then from the extremely happy feeling, I turned to be sad and normal. It does not matter anymore for these efforts. But I will try to complete my website. It is fun and my promise for years with you. I guess I will merge the website and CV together soon (right now they are on 2 different repositories).

Today I run. Yes, I did not type wrong. I run around the campus for sweating. It was good and refresh. On the run, I passed by a govt funded incubator on tech prototype. Every year, the Indian Govt funds this organization 1 crore to support 10 starts up on new innovation. Each start up will get 1 lakh ( US$1,500) for whatever the heck they want to do. This is the joint program of Indian Govt and the Department of Computer Science of my university. I told the officer that please fund me as well. Because I am working on my own tech project but they refused. huhu. They said they only fund exclusive and innovative ideas. lol. It was a good joke.

Then I read news on the Corona Virus. I realized that the media is extremely exaggerating this epidemic. Because if we compare the percentage of death rate of this novel virus with other great diseases, it is almost nothing. For example, the death rate of Sars virus in 2003 was 10% (813/8437 people died) and Ebola virus in 1976 was 43,9% (15,158/34,453) while the death rate of Corona Virus is 2,1% (362/17,491) as of Feb 02, 2019. In addition, the total of recover case is 536 out of 17,491. This demonstrates that there are so many shit information as well as fake news created on over the Internet intentionally or unintentionally. I am not happy at all. I think I will research more to decided if need to scare of it or not. Hihi. Am I talking like you? I think YES at some points.

Alright, I will go to sleep now. Hopefully you will have a good day.
I really miss your voice. Many times in the day, my emotional side said that I should email you although I think you blocked me on email too. But luckily, the rational side immediately said that "NO. Give him peace!". That is how I survive today. I hope I will be fine soon.

I miss you and still can not stop thinking about you.
