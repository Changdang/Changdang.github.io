<b> PREAMBLE OF VIETNAM CONSTITUTION 1946 </b>

The August Revolution won back the sovereignty for the country, freedom for the people and founded the republican democratic regime.

After 80 years of struggle, the Vietnamese nation has freed itself from the colonialist yoke and at the same time abolished the
feudal regime.

The Fatherland has entered a new stage of its history

The duty of our nation at this stage is to defend the integrity of our territory, win back total independence and rebuild the country on a democratic foundation.

Having received from the people the responsibility to draft the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, the National Assembly recognizes that the Constitution of Vietnam
should record the glorious achievements of the Revolution and be established on the following principles:

(i) The union of all the people, irrespective of race, sex, class and religion;

(ii) The guarantee of the rights of democratic freedom;

(iii) The establishment of a strong and enlightened people’s power.

Fortified with the traditional spirit of unity of the struggle of the whole people and under a broad democratic regime, independent and unified Vietnam is marching forward on the path of glory and happiness, in the same rhythm as the universal progressive movement and in accordance with
humankind’s wish for peace.
