By Kim In Yook

Mass is not proportional to volume.

A girl as small as violet,

A girl who moves like a flower petal,

is pulling me towards her with more force than her mass.

Just then, I am like Newton's apple,

I rolled towards her without stopping

until I fell on her, with a thump.

With a thump, my heart keeps bouncing between the sky and the ground.

It was my first love.
