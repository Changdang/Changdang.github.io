The 2nd day

How are you today? Are you getting forward with your project?  Do you feel good? Did you get stuck with the coding? Or does everything go smoothly? How well are you preparing for your dreams? What will you do today? Will you go jogging? Will you go to the coding meet up today? What food will you have today? I wonder if you have a good day today? And are you still angry with me?

Yesterday, I confessed with Panita how annoying I was during this time. She is the one made me realize that I am truly not a listener (Panita is better than Nana in comforting and helping me realize the problem. Maybe she experienced this alot ). Her advising words were gentle, but they sharply went into my heart. She also helped me realize that I need to stop emailing you and let the time heal everything.

At first, I was very happy that I realized my mistakes. Then I felt very sad for the things I made. You really cared about me but I was so neglected, stupid and naive. I realized that what the heck I was doing and what should I do to get better? The only thing I can think about is pushing my project on Github. Because this is the only way to make me feel that we still have a connection.

After getting home from school, I started working on pushing my directory on Github. It was quite easy except the fact that the picture in the front page of my website did not show up. I was so disappointed and angry when things went wrong. I tried to get calm and came up with a solution. That is publishing my picture on some website to get the URL link and including it in the src attribute of the HTML link element. However, it did not work. Then I decided to go to sleep because I did not sleep the whole night before. I was so tired.

The next morning, I woke up and worked on the problem with the picture again. Finally, it worked. I found out that I just need to change the tag name of the picture file to uppercase from lowercase (for example, change jpg to JPG).

However, another problem appeared. That was I did not know how to update my directory on laptop to the repository on Github (changdang.github.io) properly. It took me a while to solve the problem. I was almost gave up and so so crazy, but I decided to take a shower, have breakfast and came back to the problem again. And it is solveeeeed. I now know how to directly update my repository on Github from Atom too. It was so amazing because this saves time and makes me feel like I am a pro. hehe. (Yesterday, I had to change and update the bugs directly on Github page. This way was so manual and unprofessional). The process of fixing these problems was definitely more stressful and time consuming than a few words I wrote here. But I enjoyed the process. It taught me how to be calm.

Ah. I also looked at your spirobel.github.io too. I read the only post on "What the programing language should I learn?" over and over again. But I am sorry, I still do not understand. I only know that to decide which programing language should one learn, he needs to first learn about the Von Neumann architecture as all the types of computer are based on it. Apart from it, I like this part:

  > *Learning something new usually involves making something appear less magical. This does not work when it comes to computers. Computers are clockworks whose behavior can be changed by words.*

You are right. Learning something new will make it less magical. But for computer, it is still the same. hihi. Hopefully this will motivate me working on this website as long as possible.(For the part about clockworks, I need to learn more to understand what you meant).

I went jogging today too. But I think actually it was not jogging but walking. lol. I went walking with my classmate who stays in the hostel building next to. During the walk, I and him talked about the class issues. We have so many issues at school such as low quality lecture, improper attitude of journalism teachers (they teach us how to be unbias, but they are bias lol), Indian politics, Indian diversity, etc. Just to be clear that I do not love anyone except you atm. I just want to talk with someone to get myself distracted from thinking of you all the time.

I learned how to be a listener too. I listened to my classmate's words and asked him questions about his issues. I tried not to talk about myself all the time. I also learn how to listen my Vietnamese friends here and my family today too. It seemed fine. I also asked caring questions. Panita said it is aukai to ask normal questions like what are you doing? What will you do today? these questions I rarely asked you because I was afraid of boredom and investigation. But this questions are caring questions actually. I was wrong.

I am sorry that I still thought of you today when recalling nice memories we had. And I predict that this will last for a while. The more I realized how bad I was with you, the more I feel guilty and wish to change myself at best. I also want to confess that yesterday I called some visa consultants for visa to Germany. But it was Saturday, all agencies that picked my call said the same thing. That was they can not support non-Indian nationals with Schengen visa. My wish is to see you again even for a moment and you are with new girlfriend. But I think I can not see you in Germany right now. It will take time and cost a lot of money. But I will do that.

Alright it is enough for today words. I will continue to learn HTML and CSS to structure and style my website better. The website still looks so bad with texts filled all over the screen.

I wish you have a good day with whatever you are doing. I do not think I can ask questions that make you feel that you are cared or the sympathy anymore. I lost in touch with you already and perhaps you will never know I wrote here. But it is aukai. You will get peace of you life while I have a place to write my thoughts down and improve the English writing skills.
