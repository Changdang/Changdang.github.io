Hey!

This is Trang. I am from Vietnam and temporally residing in Pune City, India to pursue my higher education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

At the moment, I am on my way of recovering from the existential crisis which I never paid pretty much attention to. At the age of 25, I hope it is not too late to start all over again.

Ever since the hidden existential crisis was discovered, my life purpose is slowly shifting from materialistic aspirations to striving for a meaningful, mindful and healthy life.

Creating my own website and staying in India were never my dreams before. Right now, I am enjoying the process of making those dreams come true.

Most of the time, I like to take pictures, edit videos, watch romantic dramas, read historic books, cook (because home made food is cheap and healthy), travel around and learn to love people and the world, albeit I am not a hippie. &#128536; &#128579;

If you feel like we are meant to be friends, leave me a message on my social media handles. Thank you!
