This is Trang. I am from Vietnam and temporally residing in Pune City, India to pursue my higher education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

At the moment, I am on my way recovering from the existential crisis which I never paid pretty much attention to. I hope it is not too late to start fixing what is wrong all over again.

Ever since the hidden existential crisis was discovered, my life purpose is slowly shifting from materialistic aspirations to striving for a meaningful, mindful and healthy life.

This blog is my little corner storing and recording my journey toward that mental-oriented lifestyle. If you feel like we match from what I share, leave me a message on my social media handles below. Thank you!
