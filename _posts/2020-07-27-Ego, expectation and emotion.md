One thing leads to another

Ego, expectation and emotion seems unrelated to each other. In facts, the causes of one state result in the formation of the others from the biological perspective.

Basically, the higher the survival probability of an individual is, the higher chance that individual has in maintaining his genome. Therefor, individuals constantly find ways to survive under the deception of the magic code. With chemical reactions, that competitive effort creates what is called the "me" or ego.

David McRaney, the author of How Minds Change, once said, “The ego we still think about is actually just the chemical reactions at the synapses, between ions and atoms. What forms our egos is just a certain arrangement of the biological elements. ”

From the above points, ego is the way how an individual protect himself from everything that might threaten him. That subjective ego controls his thoughts and actions to prolong the survival possibility.

Gradually, the ego creates what so-called expectation: the expectation of gaining loads of money (to have an easier life), the expectation of learning the unknowns (to satisfy himself and avoid the potential risks), the expectation of ensuring the offspring got a better life (in order to have genome maintained).

Expectations explains the motives behind all our efforts in life. Expectation of getting good grades pushes us study hard. Expectation of gaining power make us risk everything, even the live. Expectations motivate us to become the best, to fight against the enemies, to run massive amount of money, or to struggle for the society and environment.

Ironically, without the desire for power, there would be no war. Without the desire for love, there is no feeling of lovelorn. Without the desire to be recognized, there was no feeling of failure of getting poor grades or not-earn-so-much jobs. However, we tend to put ourselves in the self-made hole. Those negative experiences we get in life, actually help us learn how to move forward. Suffering and frustration give us lessons on how to avoid similar incidents in the future.

In short, ego and then, expectation trap us with negative emotions they generate. All are just the side effects of the survival code during human revolution. So why so sad and serious? Let's accept and chillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll!
