Yo! I had a crazy but fun day. How about yours, my friends!

I was freaking disappointed because I could not fold and stretch the sourdough autolyzed by the atta levain which took me a week and many past attempts to cultivate. It was super sticky and super sour. When the excitement, down moods and research are all over, I come to note down three main possibilities for failure:

1. I did not strictly conduct required steps before baking such as autolyze, bulk fermentation, shaping, final shaping, you name it. New doer should listen to old geezers' recipe. Hu hu

2. My folding skills is improper. I thought I know a lot. In facts, I know too little.

3. There might be something wrong with the starter. Because:

- I did not feed the starter the night before I autolyzed the sourdough. The unfed microorganisms in the starter will not work well after its raising peak (or actually its farts) passed.  

- I skipped the float test. I was over the moon and forgot this essential step. So yeah, goofy me!!! Float test is the simple technique which aims to check whether the starter is ready to bake or not. If the starter floats on the water surface, it is perfect for the autolyze step.

- The starter might be not mature enough for baking. It should be raised a little longer according to an old lady's advice on Youtube. She said her starter was raised in 14 days. Holy cow!!! She might be wrong or too careful as other guys said that 7-day cultivation is still aukai.

- The starter might not be cultivated properly. I occasionally did not follow the ratio of the recipe and scaled the ingredients however I like. Too cocky!!!

- The starter from 100% whole wheat flour tends to generate very tangy flavor. Because the natural acetic acid bacteria presented in the flour were generated affluently so as to break the complex carbohydrates or starch into simple glucose. More acetic acid simply means more tangy flavor. That is why professional bakers tend to choose a mixture of bread flour or all purpose flour and whole wheat flour to easily adjust and balance the sourness level. However, I personally do not like bleached and polished flour like bread flour or all purpose flour. Because after being milled away nutritional germ and bran, all is left in the wheat grain is endosperm which only comprised of simple carb structure that takes less time for the stomach to digest, resulting in instant blood sugar spike, the culprit of high blood sugar, diabetes, fatty liver, etc.

And because happiness is a process, not a destination, I prepared new batch of starter from a mixture of 50g of atta (whole wheat flour) and 50g of maida (all purpose flour) with 100% hydration. Lets see!

Besides the sourdough failure, I learned that the one I care does not recognize my efforts of self - improvement during the last 9 months. So lets be happy and learn conscientiously!
