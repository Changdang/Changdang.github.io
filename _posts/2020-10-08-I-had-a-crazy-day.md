Yo! I had a crazy but fun day. How about yours, my friends!

I was freaking disappointed because I could not fold and stretch the sourdough autolyzed by the atta levain which took me a week and many past attempts to cultivate. It was freaking sticky and super sour. When the excitement, down moods and research are all over, I come here to note down three main possibilities for failure:

1. There might be something wrong with the starter. Because:

- I did not feed the starter the night before I autolyzed the sourdough. The unfed microorganisms in the starter will not work well after its raising peak passed.  

- I skipped the float test. I was over the moon and forgot this essential step. So yeah, goofy me!!! Float test is the simple technique which is used to check whether the starter is ready to bake or not. If the starter floats on the water surface, it is perfect for the autolyze step.

- The starter might be not mature enough for baking. It should be risen a little longer according to an old lady's advice on Youtube. She said her starter was risen in 14 days. Holy cow!!! She might be wrong or too careful as other guys said that 7 day cultivation is still aukai.

- The starter might not be cultivated properly. I occasionally did not follow the ratio of the recipe and scaled the ingredients however I like. Too cocky!!!

- The starter from whole wheat flour tends to generate very tangy flavor. Because the acetic acid bacteria was generated affluently so as to break the complex carbohydrates or starch into simple glucose. More acetic acid simply means more tangy flavor. That is why professional bakers tend to choose a mixture of bread flour or all purpose flour and whole wheat flour to easily adjust the sourness. Bread flour or all purpose flout has simple carb structure, the culprit of high blood sugar, diabetes, fatty liver, etc.

2. I did not strictly conduct required steps before baking such as autolyze, bulk fermentation, shaping, final shaping, you name it. New doer should listen to old geezers' advice. Hu hu

3. My folding skills is improper. I thought I know a lot. In facts, I know too little.

And because happiness is a process, not a destination, I prepared new batch of starter from a mixture of 50g of atta (whole wheat flour) and 50g of maida (all purpose flour) with 100% hydration. Lets see!

Besides the sourdough failure, I also accepted and learned that the one I care does not recognize my efforts of self - improvement during the last 9 months. So lets be happy and learn industriously and conscientiously!
