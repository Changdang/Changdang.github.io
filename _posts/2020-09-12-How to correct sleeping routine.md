Perhaps most of us once face problem regarding sleeping quality and quantity. Young people spend sleepless night gaming or surfing Internet. Old people can not get back to sleep at mid night due to insomnia or sleeping difficulty. Poor sleeping pattern severely affects our well-beings and increase risk of serious medical conditions, such as obesity, heart disease, diabetes and short life expectancy. The good news is that our sleeping pattern can be improved if we understand the causes and then build healthy alternatives based on that.

There are 2 factors that affect our sleeping mechanism. They are circadian rhythm and sleep pressure. Circadian rhythms are 24-hour cycles that are part of the bodyâ€™s internal clock that carry out essential functions and processes. One of the most important and well-known circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle. In this sleep - wake cycle, the body generates melatonin hormone which makes us feel sleepy when it is getting dark. When the body detects sun lights or artificial lights that are seen commonly these days, the body stays awake due to the increasing of cortisol hormone. Therefore, to force the body go to sleep at the desired time, we should avoid phone usage at least 1 hour before going to sleep. Because the artificial light of the phone screen stimulates cortisol hormone which makes us stay awake all night to be produced. On the contrary, we should expose the body with sun lights as soon as we wake up so that melatonin hormone which generates the sleepiness is put at rest.

The second factor that affects our sleep is sleep pressure. Sleep pressure is an unconscious biological response that makes us want to go to sleep. Without enough sleep pressure, we won't be able to settle easily or sleep for long. Adenosine is the chemical that accumulates the sleep pressure until the body is put to sleep. The longer you are awake, the more adenosine is accumulated. When the adenosine concentration is at peak, an irresistible urge for sleep will happen. Sleep pressure can be muted by caffeine, the chemical that makes the body stay awake and alert. Caffeine stops the sleeping signal caused by adenosine in the brain by latching its molecules onto adenosine receptor. Caffeine tricks we into the feeling of staying awake while the sleepiness adenosine chemical continues to build up. When the liver dismantles the barricade of caffeine in the body, we hit with the sleepiness we should experience and the additionally accumulated adenosine. Unless we continue to add more caffeine, it is difficult for the body to stay awake. Therefore, to have the sleep quality and quantity improved, we should avoid caffeine intake 5 - 8 hours before bedtime. Otherwise, you will find yourself struggling with sleepless nights.

To sum up, circadian rhythm or the body's 24 hour internal clock and sleep pressure dominate our sleep pattern and mechanism. Understand the causes of poor sleeping quality and quantity help build proper habits towards a healthier life. Thus, to improve our sleep quality and quantity, we should:

<ul>
  <li> Avoid all - nighter for whatever cost. </li>
  <li> Avoid artificial lights before going to sleep. </li>
  <li> Avoid caffeine intake 5 - 8 hour before bedtime. </li>
  <li> Get sunlight as soon as waking up to stay awake. </li>
  <li> Get use to with consistently daily routine to solidify the circadian rhythm. </li>
  <li> Get a healthy diet. </li>
</ul>
