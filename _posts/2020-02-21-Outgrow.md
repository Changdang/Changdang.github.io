How does the verb "outgrow" mean to me?

"Outgrow" is the verb I have recently heard most. It was on social media posts or even during the conversations with my friends. I did not pay too much attention to this unimpressive word until I was accidentally in the most suitable situation to think about its meaning. I was lovelorn from long time relationship.

When I was a teenager, I outgrew a pair of child-size pants that was too tight to me. I also outgrew my favorite coke after realizing its health effects. And in this mid 20s, it is time to outgrow the first love I thought it would be the last one.

That awesome relationship might suit me in the past but perhaps, not at present or in the future. Instead of being sad, crazily admitting the mistakes and begging for a nod to resume the relationship, I accept the reality so as to outgrow for betterment and growing up.

People change, feelings change. It does not mean the love once shared was not true and real. It just simply means that sometimes when people grow, they grow apart.  

Have a good day, everyone!
