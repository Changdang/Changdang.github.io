Few things I observed today:

<ol>
<li> Following a particular diet method does not help lose weights. What so-called eat clean, low carb, IF or Keto is another trick of the food industry. They want money from us while we are always in fear due to our insecurity and greediness. Staying fit and healthy eventually depend on exercising, wise and moderate food intake and a healthy mindset and determination. That is it. </li>

<li> Solving algorithms and thinking about the web dev learning process seem stressful to me at the moment because I think I am not suitable with these fields. I am super impatient and stupid. I look at hints too fast and all the time. Also, I told myself that learning how to code is just for fun and I have no other purposes, but actually I lied to my brain. I want to seriously get a real job in this field. It is not just about having fun. I guess this is where the stress comes from. Lets just chill more. lol </li>

<li> I love learning about history. Recently I am reading the knowledge encyclopedia (similar to "natural philosophy" books in the Enlightenment era lol). I completed the history part, which is the last part of the content (space, earth, nature, human, science and history). Now I am learning the first part of the book, the space. The knowledge is still enjoyable to read but difficult to digest. What the heck is matter, subatomic particles, atom, gravity? haha </li>

<li> It is too fast for me to give up when facing difficulties. I got stress out of nothing so easily. Plus, the period is coming. This time I will deal with its emotional side effects wiser.</li>
</ol>
