Quick update about my recent life in Vietnam.

I got home in Feb 18, 2021. So, that part of the fun in India was over.

I had been through centralized and self-quarantine periods which were pretty uneasy.

I had been through a pretty unpleasant series of emotional blackmails from family.

I got a job which is quite aukai.

I got quite stressed out from workplace.

Most importantly, I am still searching for meaning of life though I enjoy my recent life to the fullest.

I realized something which is:

Friends can take advantages of you.

Noone is honest to me as much as myself.

Critical thinking is a must on a daily basis.

Going with the flow is fun if only the mind does not think too much. haha

Seeing big picture is wayyy more important than looking at parts of the picture separately.

Improving my English and communication skills are still priority.

Vietnam is not the place where I belong to. It could be wrong but it is true at this damn moment.

I wont want to please any god damn person but myself.

Well, just a few words to remember another milestone of my 20s.
