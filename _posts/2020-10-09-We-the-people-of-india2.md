Different people have different life purposes or existential reasons. Some luckily found them at early age while the majority is still searching their ultimate wants.

Those who had clear visualization of life purpose, they set particular mindsets and courses of time to facilitate the required needs to achieve the goal. They reach the destination easily as they know what to do at which stages and steps. Any interference that causes inconvenience or irrelevance with their needs will be eliminated.

Besides people with clear life purposes are people feeling lost or tremble along the journey of achieving life goals. Please do not worry! Your goal of life is sometimes not placed at the final destination, but the journey toward it.

The mindset toward life purposes also form people's different characters as the byproducts. My friend since childhood said all she wants is earn and spend money. She works industriously for beautiful cloths and trips across the country. My three friends at university think differently. The first one said she wants to spend time meaninglessly and regret the next days. She is one of the smartest friends I have ever known. However, she would prefer chill all day long to using her intelligence for better future. Other said that she would fake it till she makes it. Her character is already reflected in her profound way of thinking. The last one said that she wants to be happy in whole life. For her, doing what bring her happiness is enough. Although I have not asked a friend I really cherish, my understanding about him reveals that he wants to freely have fun with life and his passion, computer stuff. He can logically dedicated his time and efforts to make his computer-related dreams come true. As you can see, nobody's life purposes are the same. That is why people apparently tend to drift apart the irrelevance groups and approach those who share similar life goals.

For those who are objectively or subjectively drifted out of the circle due to the irrelevance. Please hold on and keep going on your own journey. Maybe one day you will stumble upon your gangs. The destination does not hold many of the things. The journey does.
