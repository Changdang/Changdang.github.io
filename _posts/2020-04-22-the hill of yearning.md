What can love drama teach us?

Recently I rewatch Korean dramas, the habit I have avoided for a while. Although these overreact stories are somehow surreal, I did learn valuable lessons in life.

<ol>
  <li>Be grateful everyday. Be grateful that the one we love is born, still exists and lives healthily. Perhaps, it is more than enough. </li>
  <li>Instead of being moody due to long distance and harsh time, why do not we try to enjoy today as if we will meet the one we love the next day.</li>
  <li>Happiness can be easily found, even in tinny acts. It all depends on the attitude we set toward. If we accept and decide to enjoy things as how it happens to be, there is nothing we need to concern about. If there is nothing we need to concern about, we find happiness. </li>
  <li>Keep silent does not mean we no longer love. Keep silent means we learn to accept and cherish the reality. </li>
  <li> Respect people's different opinions. Not all are the same.</li>
  <li> It does not matter what you eat, what you wear and where you stay. Who you decide to stay with matters. </li>
</ol>

I truly and dearly miss you. Not a single day I do not think of you during my spare time. They say time heals everything. I say time helps me realized how much I disappointed you. What I can do for you now is keep silent and talk less about my ego. I believe that if we are meant to each other, we will see each other again.
