What are your fears? Death? FOMO? 

The Corona virus and the uncertainty it is generating make me wonder whether we, the people really know what we really want or are easily affected by subjective and then objective elements just because of the fear of death?

At first I got affected by loads of information on how deadly the virus is and the fears it spread. As a result, I was worried for my ex and his family who travelling around without self protection. I was worried for myself safety. I was worried for my family. I was worried for my friends. After all I was affected by the mass because of the scare of death. But my motive start from the caring while the mass motives could be not just about caring.

My family, friends and teachers were doing the same. Because they care, they keep asking for my tracks on how safety I am and when I will flight home. My mom calls me every single days. My friends text me all the time. I am appreciated so much the love I receive and feel ridiculous somehow. Some Vietnamese nuns I know in Pune could not choose to stay or go back home, they kneed in front of the Buddha status to worship and ask for his help by playing the dice. The dice gave them answer Go home, they flight home. Other Vietnamese students also chose to evacuate themselves home because they think homeland is safer under any circumstances, the rest decided to follow because of the clans-based thinking and herd behavior. I then think whether we are aware of what we are doing or the fear of death stop us from delving into our own inners and drive us to follow what the mass created by their objective and subjective purposes?

Today, some staff from the embassy asked me if I will take the repatriated flight back home. I said no. Other friend said lets go home as it is unsafe in India and being home is safer. From my perspective, everywhere is unsafe as long as we can not manage our mentality and stop outside forces from annoying our inner peace. Also, there is no need to worry for death, the most certainty of all. We should do the meaningful daily instead.

P.S Media said people who stay outside Vietnam at the moment are being stuck from going back home. However, I do not think I would call myself being stuck in India by the pandemic. Since the outbreak broke out in March 2020 until now, I got choices to fly home with commercial and repatriated flights. After observing my friends and family's attitudes as well as actions towards the virus, choosing to stay in India for a longer time is my right choice for myself, albeit it is sound selfish (haha this is another interesting angle which will be discussed later).
