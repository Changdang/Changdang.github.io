Why are JS framework and libraries so messy?????

After a day ditching and being confused with what JS frameworks and library a newbie web dev like me should choose, I learn a few lessons that can be applied in both tech and daily life.

<ol>
  <li>Learn how to learn effectively such as problem solving and knowledge acquisition skills. Then, You can learn any things. Solid foundation keeps the building strong. </li>
  <li>Everything has its own values. Show appreciation, not complaints about what is learn even though the knowledge could be useless at that moment. In the end, everything will link together. Our neutral system learns new knowledge by linking them with old ones.</li>
  <li>Accept the unavoidably constant change of technology. Instead of chasing for new things, first understand and focus on the basics then it is easier to get the concept of whatever fast changing technology.</li>
  <li>Accept the stupidity and ignorance of the self. There are always things we thought we know but actually unknown. Put aside ego and elitism is key to approach new knowledge.</li>
</ol>
