Procrastination and inconsistency waste your time!

Yesterday was my another unproductive day. I did not get out of the bed at 5h30am, skip the rope for morning exercises, eat clean and learn JS. Instead, I woke up at 7am, made unhealthy banana cake and ice - cream because of uncontrolled craving thoughts, had excessive calories intakes, watched trash contents on Youtube and read bullshit stuff on Facebook and the Internet.

Of course, I felt guilty for the waste-of-time day but quickly found excuses to comfort myself. This is not so surprise because it is how I am normally. For example, I would say, "Well, there need to be a day-off after a week of following strict rules!" or "I promised to gift myself a self-made cake and ice - cream at weekend but Friday is closed enough, lets make cake and ice - cream today!" or "Lets restart tomorrow. Just one day!". Indeed, those instant emotion-driven thoughts are the drawbacks. They have ruined my life for years while I did not observe them thoroughly.

This early morning, I almost found excuses as usual. I almost compromised with myself until there is a voice in my head whispering, "Do not procrastinate! Be consistent!" In a second, I was about to ignore that voice and fall asleep again. However, for unknown reason, I automatically got out of the bed and completed my daily morning routine. I wondered what that voice is from. Gosh? lol no. It is just my mind figuring out that "Just do whatever the fuck it is NOW!".

Today is definitely remarkable I would say. The small accomplishment I achieved today hopefully will guide me toward a better mindset tomorrow, albeit so much time has been wasted for 25 years.
