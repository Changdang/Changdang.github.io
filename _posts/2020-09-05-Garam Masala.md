Am I a fan or anti-fan of Garam Masala?

The time being in India changes not only my outlooks on life but also my kittenish taste. Today, I enjoy Garam Masala, the traditional mixed spices in Indian cuisine that I used to hated 2 years back.

As we all know, the Chinese food would be uncompleted without MSG. Similarly, Garam Masala is the must have spice of every Indian dishes, ranging from the street food delights to high-end dining feasts. When Indian drink chai (tea), they mix whole milk and sugar with a bit of masala. When hard-working aunties cook biriyani for her picky husband and sons, she must add masala for better and authentic taste. In fact, if the diners can not detect any strong aroma from Garam Masala in Indian food, they are definitely not having authentic Indian cuisine.

The aromatic flavor of Garam Masala that made Indian food one of a kind is the combination of all different kind of spices, such as cinnamons, cloves, cardamoms, star anises, nutmegs, chillies, turmeric, fennels, etc. For those who love food with strong and aromatic flavors, Garam Masala takes them to heaven. Those who are fed and get used to with mild but subtle cuisine like Vietnamese, it is hell.

As a person who is brought up by Vietnamese dishes since childhood, Indian food is definitely horrible to me. Garam Masala is the culprit making me spend more time in the toilet every time I have Indian foods on the early days I first came to India. Too much strong spices does not give my stomach and kittenish taste pleasant feelings. Gradually, I replace Indian foods with homemade Vietnamese or Western dishes if possible. I thought I would never try Garam Masala again. It turns out, I was wrong. As the time went by and my journey in India almost comes to an end, I cook and enjoy food spiced with Garam Masala for no specific causes.

What changed my taste the way I never expected? To be honest, I am still searching for the answer. Perhaps, when someone's ego accepts to bow down, he starts looking at the surrounding world with more widening eyes, a humble attitude and a inquiring mind. Well, it could be the reason for why I enjoy Garam Masala again after such a long time! Finally!
