Am I a fan or anti-fan of Garam Masala?

The time being in India changes not only my outlooks in life, but also my kittenish taste. Today, I cook and enjoy Garam Masala, the traditional mixed spices in Indian cuisine that I hate the most since I first came to India 2 years back.

As we all know, the Chinese food would be uncompleted without MSG. Similarly, Garam Masala is the must have spices of every Indian dishes, ranging from the street food delights to high-end dining feasts. When Indian drink chai (tea), they mix whole milk and sugar with a bit of masala. When hard-working aunties cook biriyani for family, she must add masala for better taste and flavor. In fact, if diners can not detect any aromatic and full of spices smell in Indian food, they are definitely not having authentic Indian cuisine.

The aromatic flavor of Garam Masala that made Indian food one of a kind is the combination of all different kind of spices, such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, star anise, nutmeg, chilly, turmeric, fennel, etc. For those, who loves plentiful and aromatic flavor in food, Garam Masala takes them to heaven. Those who are fed and get used to with mild and not-too-much flavor cuisine, it is hell.

As a person who is fed with mild Vietnamese dishes since childhood, Indian food is definitely horrible to me. Garam Masala is the culprit making me spend more time in the toilet every time I have Indian foods when first coming to India in 2018. Too much spices does not give my stomach and my kittenish taste a pleasant feeling. Gradually, I replace Indian foods with homemade Vietnamese or Western dishes in every occasion. I thought I would never try Garam Masala again. It is turn out, I was wrong. As the time went by and my journey in India almost come to an end, I cook and enjoy food spiced and flavored with Garam Masala for no specific causes.

What changed me my taste the way I never expected? To be honest, I am still searching for the answer. Perhaps, when someone's ego accepts to bow down, he or she starts looking into the surrounding world with more widening eyes and a humble attitude. Well, it could be the reason for why I enjoy Garam Masala after such a long time!
