Thanks to my Vietnamese junior, I understand why you said I am selfish now. I hope it is not too late.

A few days ago, I drank beers with my Vietnamese junior. He had birthday, so I invited him out. We talked about all kinds of shit and of course, love. He shared with me how his crush saying he was a selfish one. Selfishness here means that he did not care about her emotions and just said how much he love her and wanted to be his girlfriend. At that moment, I truly realized what I did wrong. I did not care about what you wanted and just wrote and wrote nonsense stuff. I mean I know that I should stop stalking you but I did not accept the reality until I talked to this guy. I really appreciate this quote on the Internet because it tells me your feelings,

> “Not everything that weighs you down is yours to carry” <

This article is also good. It shows how a long lasting relationship be like with 3 requirements that I totally do not have.
<ol>
<li>Develop the emotional maturity, such as kindness, honesty, respect, emotional boundaries, compromise, and conflict resolution. I think I lack the emotional maturity a lot.</li>
<li>Reset the expectations (of love & feelings).</li>
<li>Commit (yourself and to your partner).</li>
</ol>

Love is more than sharing the feelings. I was wrong. I thought that I just need to share all good and bad feelings with my partner and he has to bear them, but it is the dead point. "Sharing is great, but relationships are about much more than handing off our feelings, wants and needs to our partners". Love is a choice and an action — not a “feeling.”

So I guess I do not need to talk more on you much I love you. Because it is also a kind of my selfishness and emotional bully. Those who can feel it, will realize it at the end.

I am making a list of things I watch and read while waiting for your communication restoration. When we can talk again, I will show you what I learned then both can get more knowledge. I would love to know how is your life recently too. I think it will be very interesting.

I also bought the external drive to free the memories on my laptop as I want to start making the videos for my Youtube channel.

Yesterday, I made the sample test with HMTL. I got 30/40 correct answers. I need to try harder for my website.

Hopefully, you will have a great day.
