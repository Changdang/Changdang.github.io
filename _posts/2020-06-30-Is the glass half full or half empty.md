Is the glass half-full or half-empty?

Perhaps, we all came across this question several times. The optimists would answer half-full while the pessimists would say half-empty. Our outlooks on lives are critical since it determines our decisions, lifestyles and fates.

Is the glass I see half-full or half-empty? Am I an optimistic or pessimistic person? Or am I a mixture of those two characters? Till now, the glass I see is, actually still a half glass of water, no matter which outlooks I take.

P/S.
Rest in peace, Godfrey! Not too long I have known you, but your life and contributions shed me aspirations to enjoy and cherish every moment I was given.
