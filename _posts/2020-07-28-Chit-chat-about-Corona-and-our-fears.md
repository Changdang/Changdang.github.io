Is death your most fear? Congratulations, you are strapped.

The Corona virus and the uncertainty it is generating expose the fact that we, human beings seem to be unaware of what we want and easily affected and trapped by the mass and media's motives because of the fear of death.

At first I got crazy by loads of information on how deadly the virus is on social media and online news. As a result, I was worried for my ex and his family who travelling around without self-protection. I was worried for myself safety. I was worried for my family. I was worried for my friends. In facts, I was trapped by the mass and the media's subjective and objective motives because of the fear of death and caring personality.

My family, friends and teachers were also similar to me. Because they care and are afraid of death, they keep asking how safety I am and when I will flight home. My mom calls me every single days. My friends text me all the time. During this hardship, I am appreciated so much the love I receive, but feel pretty much ridiculous somehow. Some Vietnamese nuns I know in Pune could not choose between staying or going back home, they kneed in front of the Buddha status asking for his help by playing the dice game. As the dice gave them answer "Go Home", they flight home. Other Vietnamese students also chose to evacuate themselves to Vietnam because they think homeland/ home is always safe under any circumstances. A few students also decided to follow the Go-Home decision of others because of the clans-based thinking and herd behavior. All those observations bring to the point that our fear of death are easily enriched by the media's subjective and objective motives. They want money from us while we are too emotional, talkative and always searching for survival possibility.

Today, some staff from the embassy asked me if I will take the repatriated flight back home. I answered no. Other friends said lets go home as it is unsafe in India and being home is safer. From my perspective, everywhere is unsafe as long as we can not manage our internal stability and let external forces whirl our inner peace. Also, there is no need to worry for death because it is the most certainty of all time.

P.S Vietnamese media said people who stay outside Vietnam at the moment are being stuck from going back home. However, I do not think I would call myself being stuck in India by the pandemic. Since the outbreak broke out in March 2020 until now, I got choices to fly home with commercial and repatriated flights. However, I chose to stay in India for a longer time because I think it is right choice for myself atm, albeit it is sound selfish.
