Which types of intelligence do you have? Is it really necessary to be smart?

When you hear the word "intelligence", what do you immediate think of? Is it the results that you see from the IQ test? If that is the case, you might think that intelligence is something we are born with. However, it is simply not true. You can increase your intelligence by learning and putting yourself through challenges. Besides, who said that verbal fluency, mathematical skills and spatial visualization are the only things that can determine how smart you are. In 1983, an American psychologist Howard Gardner introduced a theory that there are 9 types of intelligence. Lets identify these types of intelligence:

<ol>
  <li> Logical - mathematical intelligence. If you are particularly good at problem solving using logic, then puzzles involving math would be great brain-teases for you as someone with logical - mathematical intelligence. </li>

  <li> Linguistic intelligence. Do you have exceptional linguistic ability? Are you able to learn and use languages with ease? If you say yes to both questions, you are definitely possessed with linguistic intelligence. </li>

  <li> Musical intelligence. As you might imagine, people with this intelligence are sensitive to tones, pitch, rhythm and timber. That is why singers, musicians and instrumentalists are so good at what they do for the audience. </li>

  <li> Naturalist intelligence. People with this type of intelligence are more interested in nature and activities like camping, hiking and exploring. Because they are usually kind people, these nature lovers tend to go out of their ways to help nature and animals alike. </li>

  <li> Spatial intelligence. If you have the ability to manipulate 3-dimentional space to you advantage, you are likely to be suitable for careers like architecture or engineering. </li>

  <li> Existential intelligence. Have you ever had deep conversations with someone like discussing, "What is the meaning of life?" or "How did we get here, to begin with?" If you have talked to someone like that, then he or she may have existential intelligence. </li>

  <li> Interpersonal intelligence. It is the capacity to understand and communicate effectively with other people. Those with this type intelligence tend to be in professions like teachers, sales, professionals and business people who are required to regularly interact with others. </li>

  <li> Intrapersonal intelligence. This intelligence refers to the ability to understand oneself. Therefore, if you have this intelligence, you are able to regulate and analyze your own thoughts and emotions. </li>

  <li> Bodily - Kinesthetic intelligence. Think about athletics, surgeons and dancers. What do they have in common? These people all have good sense of timing and the ability to use their bodies for problem solving or performing skills. </li>
</ol>



If you can not find the types of intelligence that match you, please do not worry too much! Just focus on your skills and the abilities of solving problems. Like what obstacles are you facing at the moment and what can you do to deal with it? Is it reading more books? or is it asking someone for advice? It is crucial to learn how to solve problems because it does not matter how smart you really are. What is the point of being intelligent if you are unable to solve real-world problems?
